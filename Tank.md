## Education On How To Pick The Best Tank

Consider the tank you choose for your betta their house. Unlike you, though, your betta will *never* leave their house. Which means you have to make it a good one, because they are quite the *hermit crab*! Do you get it? Ok, anyway...

If you were to never leave your house, what would you want in it? All the necessities, right? But not just that, because you don't want to feel lie you are *stuck*. If you keep interesting things in your house and all the possessions you enjoy are in there, it won't feel so bad. 

It's the same way for a betta fish. You want to stock your tank with decor and plants. You want there to be **plenty of space** for your betta to thrive. In the U.S.A., the minimum tank size recommended for a betta fish is 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters). 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
A lot of successful aquarists use the German minimum tank standards. This is because in the U.S.A., pet stores only care about selling fish. This leads them to displaying betta fish (or other marine animals) in very small tanks so that they may attract a larger audience. 
 :::

That being said, the recommended tank size for a betta fish in Germany is 8 gallons (30 liters). This is a great idea, because the bigger your tank is, the happier your betta is. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
The bigger your tank, the less maintenance.
:::

 It sounds weird at first, but it actually makes sense. The bigger your tank is, the more water there is. This means that if something happens to the water, it will affect the tank **less** in a bigger aquarium. For example, if your water were to have some type of sickness in it, the sickness could spread much quicker through a 2.5 gallon (9 liters) than a 55 gallon (208 liters). This doesn't mean you need a 55 gallon (208 liters) tank for your betta fish. This simply means that if you have a small tank, everything is affected quicker, which leads to instability. Instability leads to a stressed out betta, which causes issues with health, and we are back at the beginning. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
A tank that is 10 gallons (38 liters) or less is called a **nano tank**.
:::

 A smaller tank also means more pollution. Your fish is a live animal that produces waste, just like you. Waste affects a smaller tank much more thank a bigger one. When there is waste, you have to clean the tank. You actually end up cleaning a smaller tank **more** than if you you were to have a bigger tank. So just because a smaller tank takes up less room, that does not necessarily mean it is the more practical or convenient option. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
Betta fish are one of the few fish (along with 370 other species out there) with a **labyrinth organ**. 
:::

 ![Labyrinth Organ On A Betta Fish](http://www.aquariadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSCN9426-cropped_zps29fd9eff.jpg)
 
 The **labyrinth organ** allows a betta fish to breathe direct air just like you. Every fish like this falls into one of these two categories: facultative and obligate. Facultative fish only use their ability when there is not enough oxygen in the water. Think of it a Plan B. Obligate breathers *must* breathe air because their gills are not capable of getting enough oxygen through the water. Betta fish are Obligates, which means they breathe air *all the time*.

 This is the reason betta fish are "surface swimmers." They can reach the most air at the top of their tank. Tis means that surface area is **extremely important**, and another reason bowls just *don't work*. Because the bowl goes in at the top, it limits the amount of air a betta fish can collect. 

 Every tank is different, and so you can't *just* pay attention to the label on how much water it holds. There are vertical tanks that are tall, there are tanks that are long and shallow, there are bowls, and there are cubes. Because the betta fish has the **labyrinth organ**, the style of tank you choose will make a *big* impact. 

 ### Tall Tanks 

 Tall tanks are not very ideal for the betta fish. Because your betta will spend over half of its time at the surface, having all that extra room on the vertical is a waste. Your betta will explore, sure, but this is certainly not the best option to get your money's worth. 

 And because the tank is tall and skinny, the top will have limited swimming and breathing space. 
 
 **In the end, a tall tank is not a good option for your betta fish tank.**

 ### Long And Shallow Tanks

 Long and shallow tanks are the best option because it provides a lot of swimming room at the top, and a lot of surface room for breathing. Because your tank is shallow, your betta can comfortably explore the lower parts without having to fear it will run out of air and not get back up in time. 
 
 **This tank is ideal and should be relatively easy to find.**

 ### Bowls

 Bowls **will never** be a good option. *Never* consider getting a bowl for *any* fish. Bowls are far too small. The average bowl holds three gallons of water, which is above the minimum 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) for a betta, but it is shaped so horribly that is feels and looks smaller. This is why shape is so important. 

 Because the bowl is shaped to go in at the top, it limits air space for your betta. Because it goes in towards the bottom as well, it limits resting space. Also, bowls can hardly ever support a hang-on-the-back filter or heating, and it is too small to house any other kind of equipment such as sponge filters. 

 **Bowls are not an option!**

 ### Cubes

 Cubes are relatively in the middle. Stylish and modern, cube tanks offer the simplicity of a bowl without the cruelty. Cubes do not angle inwards at all like a bowl, and they have the same amount of room in the top as the bottom. Cubes are second best to long and shallow tanks, but they can certainly work just as well. 
 
 **If you are adamantly against having a long tank, consider a cube.**

## Tank Mates For Your Betta

![Goldfish Pretending To Be A Shark](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/61/e1/5261e1dcb5272a6f87194069d36392ef--sharks-dream-big.jpg)

 Now that we've gone over how to pick the best tank, we have to stock it. 

Your betta fish will definitely not mind living alone, in fact, most of them prefer it. What you get to accompany your betta is all about space and level of aggression. 

**If your tank is 4 gallons (15 liters) or less, *do not* purchase another animal to live with your betta.**

This is very important. Fish in smaller aquariums tend to be more aggressive because they have less territory. If your betta lives alone, this isn't an issue. But if you plan to invite other creatures into your betta's tank, *it must be over 4 gallons (15 liters)*.

The more space you have in your tank, the less problems there will be. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
A tank that has multiple fish or fish of different species is called a community tank. 
:::

After you decide that you have enough room, you have to consider the level of aggression in the fish you want to buy. There are some fish that are peaceful, and some that are not so much. A betta fish is an aggressive fish, especially the males. **Male bettas must never be kept together.**

### Here's a list of animals suitable for a betta tank mate with a peaceful demeanor:
* Mystery Snails
  * Tank Size: >5 gallons (19 liters)
* African Dwarf Frog
  * Tank Size: >10 gallons (38 liters)
* Neon Tetra
  * Tank Size Rule: 1 gallon (3 liters) for every fish
* Zebra Snail
  * Tank Size: >5 gallons (19 liters)
* Pygmy Corydora
  * Tank Size Rule: 10 gallons (38 liters) for every 5 fish
* Microrasbora
  * Tank Size Rule: 1 gallon (3 liters) for every fish
