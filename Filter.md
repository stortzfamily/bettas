## Filters

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
Betta fish are bad swimmers.
:::

Isn't it weird? Can you imagine living in water your entire life and being a bad swimmer? It'd be rough. In the wild, betta fish live in the small streams, rice paddies, and ponds of Asia. Because they live in such a small area, the water current is very slow. 

Filters are a *must* for your betta tank (or any tank, really) but some can create quite the current. That's why when looking for a filter, it *must* be low impact or low current. Betta fish are very fragile with their fins, and a speedy current can cause stress, illness, unhappiness, fin rot, or even death. 

There are many different kinds of filters: Hang on the back power filters (where the filter attaches to the wall of your aquarium), sponge fiters (where bacteria is soaked up through a sponge) undergravel filters (where the filter sits underneath the rocks) and many more. A betta fish would just be happy with your standard hang-on-the-back filter, also called a HOB filter. If that's not your style, they'll also like a sponge filter. 

If you have a nano tank, you will need to get special fiters and heaters built for smaller areas. I happen to have HOB filters. 

### Here's a table that includes some nice betta worthy filters from Amazon!

| Filter       | Cost| Type|
|-------------|:---:|----:|
|[SunGrow Biochemical Sponge Betta Filter](https://www.amazon.com/Biochemical-Sponge-Betta-Filter-efficiency/dp/B06XKLG9HW/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527265106&sr=1-2&keywords=betta%2Bfilter&th=1)             |$8.95|Sponge|

### Sponge Filters

If you have a sponge filter, you will need to take out your sponge every 2 weeks and clean it. This means you have to squeeze/scrub it out into a bucket of water when you clean it. The actaul sponge will not need to be replaced for years. 

::: danger 
If the sponge starts to fall apart and you can see sponge particles floating in your water, get a new one immediately. It is a choking hazard for your fish. 
:::

### HOB Filters

HOB filters themselves will not need to be replaced for years, either, but the filter *cartridges* will. The **filter cartridge** is the square piece that is placed in the HOB filter. The water is sucked in to the filter near the bottom, and it passes through the **filter cartidge**. The cartirdge stops the particles of bacteria, waste, and extra food from passing along with the water. Then, clean water spouts out the top and back into the tank. 

You must replace your **filter cartridge** every 2 weeks. Cartridges are purchased in packages of 3 or more. This creates an ongoing cost, so if you aren't up to that, consider a sponge filter.

## Heaters

A heater is a major part of every betta aquarium that often gets overlooked. You *must* have a heater for your betta fish. This is also extremely important if you live in an area with extreme weather. This could mean extremely cold *or* extremely hot. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
Bettas are tropical freshwater fish, which means they like warm water with *no* salt. They need a water temperature of 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit (24-26 degrees Celsius). Keeping them too cold can slow down their immune system, and keeping them too warn can make your fish go eratic because of fear. 
:::

Just like the filters, you will need to get a mini heater if you have a tank under 10 gallons (38liters).  We're going over the hang-on-the-back heater, which connects to a power source and hangs on the wall of your aquarium. 

### Here's a table that includes the best heaters for small tanks:
