# How To Identify Illnesses In Your Betta Fish

Identifying illness in your betta is an extremely important skill and something most pet owners do not know how to do. When your cat or dog gets sick, you take them to the vet and they'll give you answers and medication. But when your betta gets sick, its up to you.

I'm here to make it easier for you! 

There are plenty of betta sicknesses out there. We'll be going over the most common. But first, we need to figure out why so many betta fish get sick.

## The Process Of Selling A Betta

Pet stores promote betta fish as fish who can live in bowls *happily* and I'm here to tell you that there is no such fish. Every fish that is in a bowl absolutely hates it, period. but the pet stores don't really care what happens to the fish after they sell it, so they do it anyway. Unfortunately, there are people who fall for this If you are one of those people, it is *okay*! It was designed to trap you, and it's fixable, so don't sweat it. If you aren't up to the challenge, please take your betta back to your store - they will take it back. Otherwise, you could sell it online or give it to family/friends. 

**Don't feel guilty. If you *really* don't want it, it will be better off with someone else anyway.**

However, if you are determined to keep your fish and you will be committed to it for roughly 3 years, go ahead! Read this article for the best possible information and give your fish a nice home worth boasting about!

Bettas are transported to stores through highways, most of the time. The roads are bumpy and it is very stressful. Have you ever seen a betta cup that had water tinted blue? That is a tranquilizing agent that’s used to keep them calm as they suffer through a long, taxing journey that usually lasts for days. 

This is more common than you think. 

But before they even get in the cups, they are placed in *very, very* small bags with hardly any water. They can barely move.

These horrible conditions and high levels of stress lead to the betta arriving at the pet store very sick. If you bring home a sick betta, do not put it in the same space as other fish. Your entire tank will have the awful bacteria in it, as well as other fish. You must **quarantine** the betta, which is when you keep it in a separate space. This could mean buying a second temporary tank until your betta recovers. 

If your betta lives alone, you will not need this. Just wait until it gets better and the bacteria will filter out of the tank until it dies off, too.

### Symptoms Of A Sick Betta Fish

- Damaged fins (holes or rips in fins often indicate a sick Betta fish)
- Color change (a sick Betta fish’s normal color may be faded)
- Disinterest in food for days in a row
- Inactive or less active than usual
- New tendency to stay at the bottom of the tank or oppositely struggling for air at the top of the tank
- Spots that have appeared around your Betta’s mouth and head
- Constant rubbing of fins or body along the side of the tank
- Swelling of body
- Enlarged or red eyes
- Pale yellow puss
- Difficulty swimming and moving

If you see any of these signs in your betta fish, there is probably something wrong. If you see multiple signs, then read the following and act immediately.

::: warning 1. Constipation
Constipation is **very common and also very curable**. It is common because bettas have high protein diets with very little fiber. It is crucial that you recognize the symptoms early to avoid more serious problems. Most of the time, you can spot it by noticing **swollen belly or disinterest in food or activity.** The cause could be that you are **feeding your betta too much**. A way to prevent this is to **feed them peas ([Feeding Your Betta Fish](http://localhost:8080/#feeding-your-betta-fish))**, and a way to cure is to **fast your betta (do not feed them) for up to 3 days**. this allows the food to be digested and passed without adding new food.

::: warning 2. Dropsy
Dropsy is a rare disease, but **it is very fatal**. It can lead to kidney failure, which will surely kill your fish. The cause is when **bacteria gets into the tissue of your fish which leads to failure of the organs**. Your fish might have poor water quality, stress, lack of nutrition, or a sudden drop in water temperature. Symptoms are bulging eyes, protruding scales (when you look at your betta from above, the scales stick out and it looks like a pine cone), swollen body, or disinterest in food or activity. There is a lot of debate on whether Dropsy is curable, but some have done it. **Go to your local pet store with a small of your tank water in a bag and have them test it.** They will direct you on how to improve water quality. **You can also find some [Betta Fix](https://www.amazon.com/Aquarium-Pharmaceuticals-Bettafix-Remedy-1-25/dp/B00BS94ZJE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527276317&sr=8-2&keywords=betta+fix) here for $5.64.** If you do not see recovery in your betta fish after awhile, it is advised that you **have it euthanized** as Dropsy is a *very* painful and stressful disease.

::: warning 3. Fin Rot
Fin Rot is a very common disease that starts at the end of the fins and works its way up to the body of the fish. **The bacteria that causes Fin Rot lays dormant in all tanks, but becomes active when the tank gets too dirty, or the fish becomes stressed or injured.** When your fish fights with another fish, Fin Rot is a threat. Fin Rot shows itself in **torn fins, receding fins, blackening/redness along the edges of fins, or blood on the tips of fins.** If it is still early, the tank can simply be cleaned and given some [API Aquarium Salt](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527280539&sr=8-4&keywords=aquarium+salt). If it's late, add some [API MELAFIX Fsh Bacterial Infection Remedy](https://www.amazon.com/API-MELAFIX-Freshwater-Bacterial-Infection/dp/B0002567SW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527281029&sr=8-1&keywords=fin+rot+antibiotics).

::: warning 3. Ich
Ich is one of the most common illnesses among betta fish. Ich is present in the majority of fish tanks and aquariums. Every time your fish is healthy, it grows a natural immunity to this disease, which is nice. **Ich is caused by a parasite that uses the betta as its host.** Once it falls off the body, it multiplies at the bottom of the tank. These new parasites live at the bottom waiting to reattach to another fish. **Ich can also be carried in frozen live food, so be careful about where you get it from. Ich looks like small white dots all over your fish. You can treat the whole tank with [Formalin and Malachite Green](https://www.amazon.com/Fritz-Aquatics-Mardel-Quick-Aquarium/dp/B00ZXASAOK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527279078&sr=8-4&keywords=formalin+and+malachite+green).**

::: warning 4. Popeye
Popeye is a bacterial infection which **causes a betta's eye to poke out of its socket or to swell.** This can happen to one or two of the betta's eyes. It is caused by **poor water quality or not enough water changes**. Popeye can usually be cured by catching up on those **water changes for a few days in a row and adding 1 teaspoon of [API Aquarium Salt](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527280539&sr=8-4&keywords=aquarium+salt) per 2 gallons (10 liters). If the swelling does not diminish, you may need to purchase antibiotics such as [Dr. G's Anti Bacterial Caviar](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Gs-Anti-Bacterial-Caviar/dp/B00O0Z1316/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527280337&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=antibiotics+popeye+fish).**

::: warning 5. Swim Bladder Disease
Swim Bladder Disease is more common in young betta fish. In most cases, it is caused by **the result of previous injuries from fighting or transportation.** It could also be the result of **poor water quality or overfeeding.** If it is affecting a female betta, there is a chance it was from **damage occurring during mating season.** You can pinpoint this sickness by recognizing the signs: **Difficulty/abnormalities when swimming, difficulty  swimming upward, loss of balance, or swimming on its side.** Typically, a betta will **cure itself within a few days.**

::: warning 6. Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a very rare disease in fish, and they will **become sick very quickly for no apparent reason.** It progresses very quickly, and you may not even know your fish has it until it passes away. **There is no known and reliable cure for Tuberculosis. Symptoms are open wounds, weight loss, bent spine, fin rot, and other abnormalities.** It is commonly recommended that you **throw out anything that comes in contact** with a betta with Tuberculosis. Be very careful if you believe your betta has Tuberculosis because **some humans have been known to contract small scale Tuberculosis via their sick fish (it is generally just a dermatological issue as the bacterium usually enters the skin via small cuts when you are performing aquarium maintenance).**

::: warning 7. Velvet
Velvet is very common and is caused by parasites that attach themselves to a betta. The parasites protect themselves with a hard shell while **they feed on the betta's skin cells.** Once they release themselves, the multiply at the bottom of the tank and then reattach in greater quantities. **You can diagnose this illness by spotting a golden dust like appearance on your betta's body and fins, clamped fins, loss of appetite, or your betta will scratch itself against the tank walls.** The cure is to **raise the temperature up to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius)** for a little bit. The parasites cannot thrive in these conditions, but neither can your betta, so do it quickly. **Then use commercial [Formalin and Malachite Green](https://www.amazon.com/Fritz-Aquatics-Mardel-Quick-Aquarium/dp/B00ZXASAOK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527279078&sr=8-4&keywords=formalin+and+malachite+green). It is important that you treat all fish in the tank because Velvet is very contagious. Make sure to also clean the tank and do a water change.**

## Conclusion 

As you can see, water quality affects betta fish the *most*. Just because they are small fish, or are advertised as being able to fit in small spaces *does not* mean they are incapable of getting sick. Poor water quality is a *huge* problem, and you can fix it by doing water changes and scrubbing algae out of your tank weekly. 

Also keep in mind that adding any medicine into your tank is risky. Anything man made and unnatural will always be risky for your betta. It is up to you to determine if the risk is worth the reward. Often times, your betta will die anyway if you don't treat it. But we recommend always going about treatment naturally before buying products. 

This means adding more aquarium salt and mixing it very thoroughly. It could also mean doing better and more often water changes. If your betta is sick, there is a possibility you are doing something wrong. Don't sweat it, you are here to learn!
