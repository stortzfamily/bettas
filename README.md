## Introduction

Betta fish (also known as the Siamese Fighting Fish or Betta Splendens) are a very popular fish choice among aquarists. Easy for the beginner, and enjoyable for the advanced, the betta fish is a nice addition to everyone's home. 

The betta fish are native to Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. They are members of the family *Osphronemidae*. In the wild, their colors are actually very lackluster. But the fish in captivity have been bred for vibrant colors and showy tails, leaving them sought after by many. 


The reason betta fish are kept in small cups at your local pet store is their aggressive nature.

::: danger WARNING
 **Male betta fish are very aggressive towards each other, and should **never** be kept together.**
::: 
 
 Females can tolerate each other on some occasions, but not always. A group of females kept in a group is called a sorority tank. 

A sorority tank must be an **absolute minimum** of 10 gallons. The phrase all aquarists will tell you is "the bigger the better" (or the "bigger the *betta*," if you will). Established hobbyists recommend 20-30 gallons for the best success. No more than 10 female betta fish should be included, and the rule is 1 betta fish for every 2 gallons. 

Your betta fish, no matter what gender, will not be bothered by living alone all of its life. Betta fish have a lifespan of 2-3 years under the proper care. The idea that betta fish live only 6 months is 100% myth. In actuality, it is only because their people do not take care of them. That is only the truth. 

If you do not wish to put in the effort of having a fish, please **do not** purchase one. If you are not looking forward to having 3 years of your life committed to a fish, **do not** purchase one then, either. An animal should not be a *hobby*. A betta fish is a being with a soul, and it depends on *you* just like a child. It is your very own and it requires attention and good care. I promise you will be rewarded. 


### Here's a list of things you'll need for your betta fish:

* Aquarium (minimum is 2.5 gallons or 9 liters)
* Heater
* Filter
* Filter Cartidges
* Live/Fake Plants
* Substrate (optional)
* Decor (optional)
* Freshwater Master Test Kit
* Food
* Aquarium Salt
* Water Conditioner
* BettaFix (optional)

## Feeding Your Betta Fish

A betta fish requires a good diet. Their beautiful fins and striking colors aren't there because they eat bad food. By feeding your fish a nice, nutritious meal, you boost its immune system, energy level, happiness, color, and fin health. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT:
While it was previously believed that the memory span of a fish was only 3 seconds, scientists now believe that fish can remember things for *up to 5 months!*
:::

Bettas will eat pellets, freeze dried brine shrimp, freeze dried blood worms, peas, or mosquito larva. 

When it comes to pellets, there are color enhancing or normal pellets. If you feed your betta fish something really nice like brine shrimp, it may refuse to eat pellets ever again, though. Using a combination of peas and pellets works nicely. The pellets are *very* small, so don't put too many in there.

::: tip INTERESTING FACT
A betta's stomach is the size of its eye. 
:::

This means that you can only fit about 2-4 pellets in there. You want to achieve the softly rounded belly is all. If you want to do a pellet diet, I recommend 3 pellets a day with a pea once a week. 

If you'd like to bump it up a notch, freeze dried brine shrimp and bloodworms and mosquito larva work very nicely. Larva is very hard to find, sometimes. 

#### How To Feed Your Betta A Pea
Peas are very slimy, and when your betta eats them, they clear its digestive system and help to prevent diarrhea and/or constipation. Do not feed your betta pellets the day your give it the pea. This is extremely important. That's simply too much food for them in one day. 

First, you **must cook the pea**. I just wait until I cook peas for myself and put the leftovers in a bag. Then I keep them in the fridge until I feed them to my betta. 

::: danger
**Do not feed your betta buttered/salted/peppered/ peas!** 
::: 

Pick out the peas intended for your betta before you put *anything* on them. 

After you have cooked the pea, take off the outside layer of skin. This is too hard for your betta to chew, and it will only choke it *to the death*. *This is important.* Then, you have the inside of the pea, which must be divided into *the size of your betta's eye*. Once your pea is in separate pieces, you can place them in your tank. 

::: danger WARNING
You should only feed your betta 1-2 bites of pea the size of its eye in a day.
:::

They'll sink to the bottom and your fish probably won't notice them right away for the first couple times. Mine usually doesn't go to the bottom of his tank long enough to see them at first. But when he does, he head butts them, and then he starts to nibble at them. It's very funny to watch.
