# Tank Maintenance

Knowing how to clean a fish tank is one of the most important tasks a fish keeper must know how to do. Cleaning a tank is fairly easy once you do it a couple times, and it's not *doing* it that's so horrible, it's getting around to it. Most people just put it off, but if you want your fish to live for longer than 3 months, *you'll find a way to make time.*

Actually, your regular tank cleaning should take no longer than 10-15 minutes, which is even shorter than it takes to wash your dog! So let's get into it.

## Cycling Your Tank And Acclimating Your Betta 

First, we need to go over cycling your tank and acclimating your betta fish before we learn how to clean it.

::: tip INTERESTING FACT:
A tank that has been **cycled** is called a **mature tank.** The act of cycling your tank is when you get a new tank and wait for the water to be cycled through the filter and heated. When this is done, the water has been there for some amount of time, allowing *helpful* bacteria to establish itself. Cycling your tank is a *must* and takes about 3 weeks.
:::

Cycling your tank is *very* important. By cycling your tank, helpful bacteria and algae spread and establish themselves. You cycle your tank with everything in it except the fish. So if you want to add live plants, put those in and cycle your tank for 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks is up, add your betta. If you decide you'd like to add more plants/fish in later, it won't be a problem. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT:
Adding your plants in while your tank is cycling helps it cycle better and faster. 
:::

Now that your tank is cycled, it's time to go get your fish. Or, maybe you've already had it all this time. Maybe you put it in a temporary tank or kept it in its cup for those three weeks. That's all fine. 

When you've got your fish, you have to acclimate it. This is very serious because the cup your betta comes in will not be heated or filtered. The different temperature and quality of your water and its current water can shock the betta. That's why you should put your betta is a bag/cup/clean container of any kind, and let it float in the water of your tank. Seal it up (your betta can survive on the oxygen in there for a while at least, and this step is not permanent so there is no need to worry if it is getting enough air) so that the water from the pet store does not leak out into your water. 

If you can, turn off all lights at this time. Bettas don't really like strong lighting and it's a general rule that darkness = less stress for your fish. So at any other point in it's life when it is stressed, place your betta in a mildly dark room.

Now let the betta float for about an hour. An hour is perfect because if the fish sits for too long, ammonia could build up. But if they sit for too little, they could still be shocked. That's why 40-60 minutes is perfect. 

After the betta has been there for an hour, gently lower the container into the water. **Do not just *dump* your betta into the water. This causes stress, and could damage fins.** Bettas are curious creatures, and they will swim out to explore their new home willingly. 

::: danger
**Never use a net on a betta fish to remove them from/place them in a tank. It will damage their fins. It is always best to use the cup they came in, or some other container. If you hold it in the water, they will swim into it, and you can take them out that way.**
:::

If you have lost the cup or it has grown too dirty to save, here's a great substitute. It's called a [Dip And Pour](https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Tominaga-Oscar-ATO1294-Container/dp/B003WRC8CQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527607077&sr=8-2&keywords=dip+and+pour+fish+container) and it is a medium sized container that can also hook onto the side of your tank. 

*It is not a fry container, it does not have holes. It is for containing your fish while they cannot be in the tank.* A **fry container** is a small container that also hooks on your tank, but on the inside. Breeders use it to separate fry (young fish) from others. 

A [Dip And Pour](https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Tominaga-Oscar-ATO1294-Container/dp/B003WRC8CQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1527607077&sr=8-2&keywords=dip+and+pour+fish+container) can be used to quarantine a sick fish, or remove a fish while cleaning, or holding a fish wile transporting. It can also be used during water changes to take old water out or put new water in.

## How To Complete A Water Change

A water change is when you take old water out of the tank and put new water in. This is done because after the same water builds up for a while, it becomes toxic. You never see a body of water that doesn't move in nature, right? At least not a healthy, clean body of water. But because your tank doesn't have a new source of water and a place to put the old on its own, you have to do it.

A water change should be done every 2 weeks if you have a filter. **Trust me, having a filter is the best decision you will ever make.** If you don't have a filter, the water needs to be changed every 3 days, and that's just too much. 

That means you'd do roughly 2 water changes per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So in the end, not having a filter means you have to do about 104 water changes in a year. Having a filter takes that number down to 26, *which is so, so worth it.*

Now, you'll hear people say, "Oh, I just did a 55% water change last week!" 

You figure out how much water you want to take out by percentage. Just look at your tank, and take out a quarter of the water. That's a 25% water change. A little deeper would be a 30% water change. You take that out, throw it out, and add new water until it reaches the same amount of water in the tank you had before. 

**Doing a 55% water change is never good.** It's too stressful for your betta to invite that much new water without being acclimated like you did the first time. 

If you have a bowl or no filter (huummmph), then you should do a 45% water change every 3 days. This is very stressful for your betta, but it's what's needed to keep your bowl/non-filtered aquarium clean enough. Or you could upgrade to a bigger tank! Follow the link to read out tank page 
[here!](http://localhost:8080/Tank.html) 

If you have a filtered aquarium (good for you!), then you need to do around 25% every 2 weeks. If you own a HOB (hang-on-the-back filter) your **filter cartridge** will most likely need to be changed at this time, too. 

But I'm afraid it is not as simple as just exchanging old for new. You see, new water is not safe for bettas (or any other fish, for that matter) until it's been altered by you. 

::: danger
**Your water must be tap, bottled, or betta specific. Never use distilled water or well water.**
:::

Tap water is readily available at your home and less expensive than bottled or betta specific. You *will* have treat it with [Betta Water Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-Betta-Conditioner-Dechlorinator-3-Pack/dp/B019HF0GNE/ref=sr_1_11_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616508&sr=8-11&keywords=fish+water+conditioner) and [API Aquairum Salt.](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616572&sr=8-3&keywords=api+aquarium+salt)

Bottled spring water doesn't have chlorine in it, so it is safe for bettas *as long as it falls within the pH levels of a betta fish, 7.0. Always make sure to check the pH for 7.0 before adding it into your tank. You can test it using this using [API Test Kit.](https://www.amazon.com/API-250-Test-Freshwater-Aquarium-Water/dp/B000255NAK/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527616730&sr=1-1&keywords=ph+test+kit+aquarium) Depending on where you live, the water companies around you get there water from different sources. Unless you are sure that those sources do not add chlorine to their water, condition your tank with [Betta Water Conditioner.](https://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-Betta-Conditioner-Dechlorinator-3-Pack/dp/B019HF0GNE/ref=sr_1_11_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616508&sr=8-11&keywords=fish+water+conditioner) You will also need some [API Aquairum Salt.](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616572&sr=8-3&keywords=api+aquarium+salt) 

Betta specific water is more expensive, but it is already dechlorinated and conditioned. The choice is yours if the convenience is worth the price tag. You will still need to add [API Aquairum Salt.](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616572&sr=8-3&keywords=api+aquarium+salt)

Distilled water has been stripped on minerals, metals, and nutrients until it is pure water. This is good because then it has no harmful things in it, but the absence of good things can be just as bad for your fish. Don't choose distilled water.

Do not use well water or rain water, either. You have no clue what's in it, and some areas of the planet have acid rain. It's just better to have tap, bottled, or betta specific. If you are inflexible and *must* have well/rain water, take a sample into your local pet store - they will test it for free and direct you on how to make it betta-safe. Test it often as it may change. 

When treating water remember to always put the water intended for your fish and the product into a container and mix thoroughly before adding it to your tank. 

::: danger
**Never add any type of product directly into your tank without mixing it in first. Especially any type of [Aquairum Salt](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616572&sr=8-3&keywords=api+aquarium+salt) because it will *burn* your fish.**
::: 

::: danger
**Never use table salt instead of [Aquairum Salt](https://www.amazon.com/API-AQUARIUM-Freshwater-Aquarium-65-Ounce/dp/B0010P0ZJK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1527616572&sr=8-3&keywords=api+aquarium+salt). The caking agent in table salt is dangerous to fish of all kinds.**
:::

To test the parameters (definition: a number system that sets the condition one must be in to operate), you can use a [Freshwater Master Test Kit.](https://www.amazon.com/API-FRESHWATER-MASTER-TEST-KIT/dp/B01GX7G2C8/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527620007&sr=1-4&keywords=master+test+kit+aquarium) The pH, as mentioned above, of a betta fish must be around 7.0. To see if yours is around 7.0, you can use this product.
