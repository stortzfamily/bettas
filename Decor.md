 # Betta Tricks, Betta Toys, And Betta Tank Setup

>Dr. Seuss

Picking out the best decorations for your betta tank is hard. A betta's fins are very, *very* delicate and can be torn apart if you don't pay attention to the items you put in your tank. 

## Live Plants

If you do not wish to have live plants and will instead be having artificial ones, substrate is not needed. Just keep in mind that the fish waste and other things will collect at the bottom and be much more visible when you have no substrate. This is not ideal if you are looking to have a **show tank:** a tank with no other purpose except to house your fish and look appealing. 

Here's a table that includes plants that grow well alongside betta fish:

|![Java Fern Plant](https://www.aquasabi.com/vcdn/images/item/zoom/W04JmQIbB6/microsorum-pteropus-pot.jpg)     |[Live Java Fern](https://www.amazon.com/Microsorum-Freshwater-Decorations-GUARANTEE-Mainam/dp/B074157595/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527628291&sr=8-4&keywords=java+fern)       | The Java Fern provides a nice hiding spot for your betta to feel more secure. It is also very easy to grow and great for the begginner.
|![Amazon Frogbit](http://golden-library.com/images/product/15%20x%20amazon%20frogbit%20floating%20plant%202%20x%20stems%20of%20anacharis%20-%20live%20aquatic%20plant.jpg)  |[Live Amazon Frogbit](https://www.amazon.com/Frogbits-Freshwater-Aquarium-Floating-Soshrimp/dp/B00MF669RU/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527628878&sr=1-1&keywords=amazon+frogbit+live+plant)  |The Amazon Frogbit is kind of like that of a lily pa because it has flat round leavesthat float over water. Make sure that the Amazon Frogbit does not cover more than half of your tank, because your betta does need to get to the surface of the water. This plant provides nice shade for your betta, too.
|![Java Moss](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00HJXW4B4&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=aquascapeadd-20)   |[Java Moss](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Moss-Portion-Oz-Cup/dp/B01200O8BO/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527629227&sr=1-1&keywords=java+moss+live+plant+for+aquarium)  | Java Moss is a great addition to many tanks. It adds elegance to any aquarium, and your betta may even nibble on it. There is nothing more healthy than natural food, so this is especially handy if your betta fish is on a pellet diet. However, your betta will not be trimming these plants for you. They do grow very fast, so you'll have to trim them fairly often.
|![Marimo Moss Ball](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/99/39/48/9939480bea48b5e9663fba2dabaf4f1d--marimo-moss-ball-cauliflower.jpg)  |[Marimo Moss Balls](https://www.amazon.com/LUFFY-Marimo-Moss-Balls-Aesthetically/dp/B06Y2CL89Y/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=33BWN1VJAV9YY1R7ES7G&th=1) | Marimo Balls are extremely easy to maintain and only need to be squeezed every water change to release and remove pollutants that have built up. In fact, your betta will look at them as a toy. You may have a betta that lays on or pushes them around. Marimo Balls offer great filtering and are an awesome idea if you *absolutely cannot* have a filter. They come in different sizes, and can live up to 100 years under proper care. The oldest Marimo Moss Ball is about 200 years old. 

If you do not have a filter and will not be getting one, please consider live plants and substrate for them. They are very rewarding and your betta will love it. Live plants act as a natural filter that suck up harmful bacteria for their food and then also add oxygen to the water. 

This being said... let's address the Betta Plant Myth, shall we?

### The Betta Plant Myth

There are many myths about betta fish out there. The problem is, one person will come up with it (probably *thinking* they are right, anyway) and then puts it out there. Then every other person trying to write a betta site (like myself) sees it and writes about it in their own article. The cycle happens again, and pretty soon the whole public is aware of this myth, **except none of them know that it's just that: a myth.**

That pretty much describes the Betta Plant Myth. Chances are, you've already heard about it.

The Betta Plant Myth is the idea that a betta fish can live in a vase with a plant (that is not an underwater plant like Java Fern or other plants we talked about) sprouting out the top. 

It looks like this:

![Betta Fish In A Plant Vase](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/4b/63/354b6341b46ccf074927cce2058be347.jpg)

People think that the plant will take the fish waste and use it as food, and in turn filter the water perfectly clean so one does not have to do nearly as much water changes -- or even *none at all!*

As amazing as this concept seems, it is, unfortuntely, untrue. 

The original idea is true... the plant will, in fact, use the fish waste as food and provide filtering and oxygen... but people are greatly overestimating the impact and energy of a *single plant.* And no, stuffing more plants in there won't solve the issue, either. 

Because, really, the plant provides oxygen, but it also takes up surface area and makes it even *harder* for the betta fish to breathe. Their **labyrinth organ** requires that they have oxygen from the surface. The plant will take up that surface, and if it isn't now, it will grow. This only means less surface space *and* less room in the already-very-small vase. 

Also, the plant isn't going to take *all* of the fish waste or *all* of the harmful things out of the water. It can't -- there's too much. That's why you *must* do water changes and you *should* have a filter. 

So, in the end, it suffocates your betta, leads you to belive you don't have to care for your fish, and stuffs it in a smaller place than even a bowl. 

And here I was thinking that there was nothing worse than a bowl. There is, apparently. 

If you've fallen for the Betta Plant Myth, please don't feel bad. I'm sure the first people to come up with it didn't intend to trick you... I bet they were really happy. I mean, they'd found an awesome and convienent way to keep a betta fish. Sadly, new science shows it just doesn't work the way they wanted.

If you have a betta kept in a vase, *please* find them a bigger tank. The minimum for a betta in the United States of America is 2.5 gallons (9 liters). Please no bowls. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT:
Another reason that bowls and vases are bad for fish of any kind is that the rounded walls affect their vision over time. **It's possible they could become partially or fully blind.** The bad part is you won't know when it's happened. That's why it's best to stay away from rounded aquariums of every kind. 
:::

## Fake Plants And Substrate
Now onto fake plants: fake plants pose a risk in the sense of how soft they will be. 

::: danger
**Never use plastic plants for a betta. Instead, use *silk plants.***
:::

Fake plastic plants are much too hard for a betta and will utterly tear up their fins. **Silk plants** are a great alternative for fake plants. They are not live, and they are simply fake plants made of softer material than plastic. It's much nicer than a plastic plant, and your betta will thank you. 

Most packages will advertise if the plant is silk, so they should be easy to find. Otherwise, you can put "silk plants for betta" in your browser. 

The same applies to decorations of any kind. **Do not get any decoration that is rough for your betta tank. It will rip the fins.**

Substrate is the gravel/sand/stones you put at the bottom of your tank. If your plan is to have live plants, subrate is a must. Just like your mom's flowers need soil, your betta's underwater plants need substrate if they are live.

Sand is heavily suggested because it is soft compared to other forms of substrate. Stones and sharp gravel could get a betta's fins stuck between the rocks and cause damage. Sand is best, but soft gravel would do nicely, also. 

## Betta Tricks And Toys

Betta fish are one of the smartest tropical freshwater fish out there. Most freshwater fish do not have personality, but bettas do. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT: 
Betta fish can recognize their owners and distinguish different faces.
:::

Bettas are so smart, in fact, that boredom can become a problem very fast. Just like an advanced child in school, boredom with no stimulation can lead to unhappiness, stress, or aggression. To aliviate this boredom, you can teach your betta tricks or get it toys!

### Betta Tricks

Many people teach their bettas tricks. Mine can come to my fingers, swim through a hoop, and jump out of the water breifly. 

To teach your betta to come to your fingers, all you have to do is show it that fingers equal food. It's the easiest trick out there. After feeding your betta enough times, it will associate your face with food, and your fingers. 

Maybe it will get super excited when you enter the room, or it will swim to the fron of its tank when you get close. Maybe it will wiggle when you wiggle your fingers, or maybe it will swim to them. 

To jump out of the water, you can hold some food over the water (not too high) in front of your fish, and they will jump for it. Its nose/mouth will probably hit your finger, but don't be alarmed. Betta fish do have teeth, and they can bite, but most won't and if they don't, it's so light you won't even know the difference between them biting and them tapping you. 

::: danger 
When you teach your fish a trick, they will practice when you are gone. Please cover your tank with a lid or screen so your betta fish does not jump out. Because of the labyringth organ, a betta fish can survive 4 hours out of water. But it's best not to risk it. 
:::





To swim through a hoop, you first have to get a hoop. You can buy big and cheap bracelets (mkae sure to wash them very, very well before adding them into your tank), pipe cleaners, or these hoop products from Amazon: [Betta Mermaid Hoop](https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Laboratories-Betta-Mermaid/dp/B014W0AW1U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527703481&sr=8-1&keywords=Zoo+Med+Betta+Bling+Mermaid+with+Hoop) or [Betta Diver Hoop.](https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Laboratories-Betta-Bling/dp/B014W0AY36/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527703931&sr=8-4&keywords=Zoo+Med+Betta+Bling+Mermaid+with+Hoop)

Now that you have your hoop, all you have to do is have your betta on one side of the hoop and show food on the other. Most likely, it will go around, or under, but not through. That's okay, this is probably the hardest trick so it'll take some time. Do not reward your betta if it doesn't do it right. 

Eventually, it will put two and two together and it will go through so it gets food. Then, it won't be so scared of the hoop anymore. And pretty soon it will start to go through it on its own!

### Betta Toys

Betta fish are so smart that they need activity beyond just swimming. training is a great and rewarding exercise, but what about when you are gone? Or the fish is tired? 

Here's a table of helpful and acceptable toys for your betta:

| Image |Product Name|Comments|
|-------|:----------:|-------:|
|![Betta Fish Hammock](https://japanesefightingfish.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betta-fish-toy-hammock.jpg)|[Betta Hammock](https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Laboratories-AZMBL20-Hammock/dp/B0027IZ6KW/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527708360&sr=1-4&keywords=betta+hammock)|The Betta Hammock is a very common toy. But not only is it fun, it's very healthy to have one in your tank. A betta fish sleeps and breathes just like humans, but unlike humans it needs to go to the surface of its water for air. This means the betta is constantly waking up at night just to get good oxygen because of their **labyrinth organ.** Having a Betta Hammock means there is somewhere for them to rest near the surface.        |
|![Floating Log](https://japanesefightingfish.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/floating-betta-fish-toy.jpg)|[Floating Betta Log](https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Floating-Betta-Log/dp/B0027ITKBS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527708276&sr=8-1&keywords=floating+betta+log)| A Floating Betta Log is a log that your fish can hang out in. It provides a resting place just like the hammock, but more enclosed so it serves double as a hiding space. It also features a hole at the top for feeding and air.         |

Bettas need surface, so sometimes putting too much stuff up there is bad. A Sinking Betta Log is the solution!|

Some bettas will push theirs around or lay on it. Moss balls act as natural filters, so this is a great investment.|

The training experience cures boredom, and practicing for the rest of their life will be very rewarding! Entertains you *and* the fish!|

The model for the company is a goldfish called Comet that has been named the smartest goldfish in the world.         |

Now, it hurts to think about, but many people are deeply unaware of how harmful popular betta toys can be. Sadly, people assume that because it is labeled as a "toy" it cannot hurt their betta. This is untrue. 

### Here's a list of **harmful betta toys**:

| Image | Product Name | Comments |
|-------|:------------:|---------:|
|![Betta Chasing Lazer](https://i.rmbl.ws/s8/6/B/a/b/w/Babwa.0kob.2.jpg)|Betta Lazer|The betta lazer is a *horrible* idea. I understand the logic behind it. We do it to our cats and dogs... they like it. Why not our fish. Well, you see, fish are very different from cats and dogs. They are much smaller and they live in a small space where you are likely to hit them in the eye with the lazer. While your dog could get over that, your fish is simply not as strong. Plus, with the lazer going over glass, it's bound to reflect and bounce the light in different ways that we can't see from outside the tank. Or maybe we can see, we just don't understand how harmful it is. Our eyes are much stronger. **Please don't use a laser on your fish.**|
|![Betta Mirror](https://shantiweiland.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/httpwww-practicalfishkeeping-co-ukfeaturesarticlesfrequently-asked-questions-on-siamese-fighters.png?w=640)|Betta "Exercise" Mirror|The worst of all betta fish "toys" is this exercise mirror. Please never *ever* get your betta an exercise mirror. In the wild, bettas are very aggressive towards one another. There is actually a "sport" where betta fish fight one another to death in a lot of countries. Bettas will flare at amirror in attempts to make themselves look bigger so their enemy (their reflection) will feel threatened. Constant flaring is *very* detrimental to the health of your fish. It will stress them so much they could die or contract illnesses. **Please do not use a betta mirror on your fish. It doesn't "exercise" them like the label says.** Actually, your fish will flare enough for other reasons in its life. Stress, pain, adrenaline, fear... You'll see it plenty of times and that will exercise the muscles of the fins. So they don't need to "flare on command" or flare at their reflection. It just leads to them being paranoid, and that's awful.|
