Picking out the best decorations for your betta tank is hard. A betta's fins are very, *very* delicate and can be torn apart if you don't pay attention to the items you put in your tank. 

## Substrate And Plants

Substrate is the gravel/sand/stones you put at the bottom of your tank. If your plan is to have live plants, subrate is a must. Just like your mom's flowers need soil, your betta's underwater plants need substrate. 

If you do not wish to have live plants and will instead be having artificial ones, substrate is not needed. Just keep in mind that the fish waste and other things will collect at the bottom and be much more visible. This is not ideal if you are looking to have a **show tank:** a tank with no other purpose except to house your fish and look appealing. 

Here's a table that includes plants that grow well alongside betta fish:

|![Java Fern Plant](https://www.aquasabi.com/vcdn/images/item/zoom/W04JmQIbB6/microsorum-pteropus-pot.jpg)     |[Live Java Fern](https://www.amazon.com/Microsorum-Freshwater-Decorations-GUARANTEE-Mainam/dp/B074157595/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1527628291&sr=8-4&keywords=java+fern)       | The Java Fern provides a nice hiding spot for your betta to feel more secure. It is also very easy to grow and great for the begginner.
|![Amazon Frogbit](http://golden-library.com/images/product/15%20x%20amazon%20frogbit%20floating%20plant%202%20x%20stems%20of%20anacharis%20-%20live%20aquatic%20plant.jpg)  |[Live Amazon Frogbit](https://www.amazon.com/Frogbits-Freshwater-Aquarium-Floating-Soshrimp/dp/B00MF669RU/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527628878&sr=1-1&keywords=amazon+frogbit+live+plant)  |The Amazon Frogbit is kind of like that of a lily pa because it has flat round leavesthat float over water. Make sure that the Amazon Frogbit does not cover more than half of your tank, because your betta does need to get to the surface of the water. This plant provides nice shade for your betta, too.
|![Java Moss](https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00HJXW4B4&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=aquascapeadd-20)   |[Java Moss](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Moss-Portion-Oz-Cup/dp/B01200O8BO/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1527629227&sr=1-1&keywords=java+moss+live+plant+for+aquarium)  | Java Moss is a great addition to many tanks. It adds elegance to any aquarium, and your betta may even nibble on it. There is nothing more healthy than natural food, so this is especially handy if your betta fish is on a pellet diet. However, your betta will not be trimming these plants for you. They do grow very fast, so you'll have to trim them fairly often.




































Betta fish one of the smartest tropical freshwater fish out there. Most freshwater fish do not have personality, but bettas do. 

::: tip INTERESTING FACT: 
Betta fish can recognize their owners and distinguish different faces.

Bettas are so smart, in fact, that boredom can become a problem very fast. Just like an advanced child in school, boredom with no stimulation can lead to unhappiness, stress, or aggression. To aliviate this boredom, you can teach your betta tricks or get it toys!
